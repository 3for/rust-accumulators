# Class Groups

The Group of unknown order that is used to sample our primes
RSA or Class groups of imaginary quadratic order
Binary quadratic forms 
Class groups of binary quadratic forms omits the trusted setup that RSA needs.
The order of the class group of a negative prime discriminant d, where |d| ≡ 3 mod 4, 
is believed to be difficult to compute when |d| is sufficiently large, making the order 
of the class group effectively unknown. Therefore, a suitable discriminant — and its associated 
class group — can be chosen without the need for a trusted setup, which is a major advantage for 
using class groups in applications requiring groups of unknown order.
